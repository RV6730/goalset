A Reverse Content Gatekeeper that intercepts instant gratification. Instead of blocking distraction apps, it swaps the feed with AI-generated, bite-sized lessons related to your long-term goals.

## Overview

This app simulates a mobile interface that helps users gatekeep their dopamine. When a user attempts to open a high-dopamine "distraction" app, the system intercepts the request and presents a "Future Feed"—a series of bite-sized, AI-generated learning cards based on the user's selected goals. Only after consuming this educational content is the distraction app unlocked.
